## Automated FASTQ to CNV workflow

An end-to-end Nextflow workflow now lives in `main.nf`. It automates:

1. Raw-read FastQC
2. fastp trimming
3. Trimmed-read FastQC
4. BWA-MEM mapping
5. Picard read-group addition and duplicate marking
6. filtered BAM generation with `samtools flagstat`
7. MultiQC summary
8. CNV calling with CNVkit, GATK CNV, or both

### Files

- `config/samples.tsv` - one row per sample, with FASTQ paths and CNV reference group.
- `nextflow.config` - reference genome, targets, output directory, executors, resources, and CNV settings.
- `envs/qc_mapping_cnv.yaml` - Conda environment for Nextflow and the required tools.
- `main.nf` - automated pipeline definition.

### Quick start

Edit `config/samples.tsv` and `nextflow.config`, then run:

```bash
conda env create -f envs/qc_mapping_cnv.yaml
conda activate qc_mapping_cnv
nextflow run main.nf -profile conda -resume
```

For an HPC run using the built-in SLURM profile:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile slurm -resume
```

### CNV modes

Set `params.cnv_method` in `nextflow.config`:

- `cnvkit` - build CNVkit references from samples marked `normal`, `control`, or `reference`, then call `.called.cns` files.
- `gatk` - preprocess target intervals, collect read counts, build a panel of normals, denoise, segment, and call `.called.seg` files.
- `both` - run both CNVkit and GATK CNV outputs from the same marked BAMs.

Samples with `cnv_role` set to `normal`, `control`, or `reference` are used for CNV references. Other roles, such as `case` or `treated`, are CNV-called against their `cnv_reference_group`.

## Generic ChIP-seq Nextflow workflow

For ChIP-seq, a separate generic Nextflow workflow is available in `chipseq_main.nf` with configuration in `chipseq_nextflow.config`.

### Why this is generic

- Input FASTQ files are fully controlled by `config/chipseq_samples.tsv` (no fixed filename pattern is required).
- Sample names can be any value in the `sample` column.
- Paths and run parameters are set in `chipseq_nextflow.config`, including reference genome, mapping filters, and bigWig options.

### Files

- `chipseq_main.nf` - ChIP-seq QC, trimming, mapping/filtering, optional bigWig generation, and MultiQC.
- `chipseq_nextflow.config` - ChIP-seq pipeline parameters and runtime profiles.
- `config/chipseq_samples.tsv` - sample sheet template; edit file paths and sample IDs freely.

### Quick start

```bash
nextflow run chipseq_main.nf -c chipseq_nextflow.config -profile conda -resume
```

For SLURM:

```bash
nextflow run chipseq_main.nf -c chipseq_nextflow.config -profile slurm -resume
```

## Copy Number Variation (CNV) Analysis Pipelines
GATK & CNVkit Workflows for Targeted and Whole-Exome Sequencing

### Overview
This repository provides reproducible, HPC-ready workflows for copy number variation (CNV) analysis using two independent pipelines:
1. GATK CNV Workflow — Best-practice CNV calling using the Broad Institute's Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).
2. CNVkit Workflow — Coverage-based CNV detection using CNVkit for targeted and hybrid capture sequencing.

Each workflow includes:
- Ready-to-run SLURM batch scripts for HPC clusters
- Step-by-step setup and execution guides
- Notes on parameters, expected outputs, and biological interpretation

### Reproducibility
All scripts are fully modular and can be customized per project.
Each step includes:
- Input and output definitions
- Environment setup instructions
- Optional parameters for advanced tuning
To rerun or adapt:
- Update paths in the scripts (BAM, REF, TARGETS, etc.)
- Submit each job to the HPC queue using sbatch
- Review logs and resulting CNV tables/plots

## Duplicate and fusion genes
- Manual inspection of fusioned genes 
- Using the "supplementary", "mates on different chromosomes", and mates on same chromosomes but in distant than expected" reads. 
- Compare it with Normal.
